# w3-password-generator

Week Three Challenge of the *UOB Full Stack Development Coding Bootcamp* requires students to use JavaScript to create a **password generator**. 

We were given a User Story and an Acceptance Criteria as per below:

## How I approached the task:

* Analysed the starter code from which I understood is used to display the generated password in the password text area of the HTML. 

* Broke the task down into smaller chunks - started by focusing on how to generate a random number / letter / special char.

```
// GENERATOR FUNCTIONS:
// Get ONE random number:

var numbers = "0123456789";

function getRandomNumbers() {
  randomNumbers = numbers.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * numbers.length));
  return randomNumbers;
} 
```

* Worked on creating the windows pop-up dialog box, by using the .prompt() and .confirm() methods I was able to generate a value from the user input.

```
function writePassword() {
  pwLength = +window.prompt("Length of password: ");

  //check is pw length is between 8 and 129 chars

  while (pwLength < 8 || pwLength > 130) {
    pwLength = +window.prompt("Password must be at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. Please enter length of password: ");
  };

  hasNumbers = window.confirm("Does the password include numbers?");
  hasLowercase = window.confirm("Does the password include lowercase letters?");
...
}
```

* Created a **generatePassword()** funtion which filters out user selection, and a **for loop** to loop over **pwLength**.

```
function generatePassword () {
  let password = "";

  if (hasNumbers === false && hasLowercase === false && hasUppercase === false && hasSpecialChars === false) {
    alert("You need to select at least one character type. Please try again!");
  } 

  if (hasNumbers) {
    //possibleChars += numbers;
    possibleChars = possibleChars + numbers;
  }

  if (hasLowercase) {
    //possibleChars += numbers;
    possibleChars = possibleChars + lowercase;
  }

  if (hasUppercase) {
    //possibleChars += numbers;
    possibleChars = possibleChars + uppercase;
  }

  if (hasSpecialChars) {
    //possibleChars += numbers;
    possibleChars = possibleChars + specialChars;
  }

  for (var i = 0; i < pwLength; i++) {
    password += possibleChars.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possibleChars.length));
  }

  return password;
```

* In between these steps, I also ran **console.log()** to ensure I am getting the result required.

Re-prompt if (pwLength < 8 || pwLength > 130):

n.b. Users are also asked to confirm uppercase letters and special characters, once all methods are satisfied, a password is generated in the #password text area. If no character types are confirmed, the user is alerted to retry.

### Final note:

*Any feedback to improve code or areas where I could further implement best practice would be greatly appreciated* ðŸ˜Š
